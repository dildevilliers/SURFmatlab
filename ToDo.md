# ToDo list for new code

## @Farfield
- Add better principle plane cuts method for cartesian/polar
- Plot on 0:180 or -180:180 in y (then x in -90:90)
- Add real and imag e-field plots
- Fix 3D plot for negative y-(th)axis cases
- readGRASPcut
- readCSTffs
- readFEKOfft
- readFITS
- readMeasurements
- Subtraction of fields (for error calculations and comparisons)
- Norm of fields (for error calculations and comparisons)
- Stokes getter
- Stokes plotter
- Field rotations
- Resample fields into new object (feature based interpolation)
- SWE of a given field
- Resample of SWE results on different grid
- Use above resample for interpolation when plotting
- CBFP expansion
- CBFP/SWE/Zernike interpolation in freq
- General CBFP/SWE/Zernike interpolation over parameters
- Zernike expansion
- Single frequency getter (from index)
- Multiple frequency concat
- Array pattern adder
- Normalise to isotropic
- Calculate power through field integration
- Shift field in 3D space - phase change
- writeCSTffs
- writeFEKOfft
- writeGRASPcut
- Typical pattern parameters calculator
- Gaussian pattern fitter
- Generate FarField from specified gain pattern
